			<ul>
				<li>
					Games will be played in selected maps from the map pool, 
					and according to the following rules: 1k start, no ring heros or custom heros, 
					no Arnor faction, no handicaps. Both random and picking faction are allowed. 
					Everything else is also allowed ingame, except easter eggs (which are practically 
					inexistent in our map pool, with some wildman exception :D ).
				</li>
				<li>
					Both players have to agree before the game that they will play ranked. To show that, 
					put a "Clan tag" (for example: {ER}MaxPower) in the username. Once they agree, they 
					have to play and accept the result, there is no way to change mind after the game.
				</li>
				<li>
					All players involved need to be registered when submitting the replay, players without 
					registration cannot participate in the rankings nor the ranked games.
				</li>
				<li>
					Each player starts with 1000 ELO points, which will increase and decrease according to 
					their victories or loses. The amount of points won/lost depends on the rating of both 
					players. To update rankings, replays have to be submitted in the website. Each replay has 
					some data to be filled by the uploader: all information has to be correctly submitted, if 
					not: small punishment. The replay can be uploaded by any player, but it is recommended that 
					the uploader is the winner of the game. In any case, the uploader is responsible for 
					submitting accurate data to the system.
				</li>
				<li>
					Each player can only have 1 account. Please use your known username.
				</li>
				<li>
					Submitting fake replays or cheating in some way (replays where not both players wanted to play 
					ranked, etc) will be punished.
				</li>
				<li>
					To avoid microcosmos in the ranking (for example, 2-3 friends that only play between themselves 
					and therefore are not ranked according to the general community, resulting in inaccurate scores), 
					there will be a maximum of 5 simultaneous replays between the same 2 players allowed. After that, 
					they cannot keep being ranked by playing each other and have to look for other partners. If even 
					then we observe creation of microsmos, we will make this rules more strict.
				</li>
				<li>
					For the moment, inactive players will retain their points. This will likely change in the near future, 
					and also according to your feedback :)
				</li>
				<li>
					Replays will never be deleted unless there was a bug or the information posted was incorrect. Replay 
					data will be used to generate much needed statistics that need as many replays as possible.
				</li>
				<li>
					IF a game ends in out of sync, or because wildman invasion starts on FoI2, or by other unpredictable 
					circumstances, the game won't be uploaded, unless both players agree on a clear winner.
				</li>
				<li>
					All rules are subject to changes.
				</li>
