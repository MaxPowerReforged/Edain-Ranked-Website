					How does Edain Ranked work?<br>
					Edain Ranked is a ranking system for Edain Mod pvp players, which uses replay submissions
					to add/remove points to each player. Additionally, each replay submited gets displayed in 
					the <a href="replay_database.html">Replay Database</a>, where you can download games from 
					other players to learn their strategies, how the matchups play, the current Meta, etc.
					From all the replays, we are able to get some <a href="Statistics.html">Statistics</a>, which
					provide interesting information about balance, player preferences, and other factors.

			<h3>Getting Started</h3>
			<article>
				<p>
					All the website is public, but in order to upload replays you need to register. This is necessary
					to avoid anonymous players submitting games, which could lead to cheating. You can easily 
					<a href="register.html">register</a> and start uploading games.
					<a href="rules.html" target="_blank" class="warning_info">Make sure you read the rules first!</a><br>

			<h3>Finding players</h3>
			<article>
				<p>
					In order to find players, you need to get familiar with BFME's multiplayer scene, which involves
					3rd party software to work. The most widely used programs are Gameranger and Hamachi, for which
					many <a href="https://www.gamereplays.org/battleformiddleearth/portals.php?show=page&name=gameranger-guide">
					guides</a> already exist.<br>
					As Edain's pvp community is quite small, finding players in Gameranger can get tricky. I strongly suggest
					to get into <a href="links.html#links_discord">Edain's unnoficial Discord Servers</a>, to get in touch with other players easily,
					and participate in discussions about the mod, the pvp experience, etc.
					Take note, that some players prefer not to use the ranking system for various reasons. As stated in 
					the rules, always ask before the game starts if your opponent wants the game to be uploaded, and use some
					tag (for example, MaxPow{ER}) to indicate your intent to play ranked games. Otherwise, the game won't be
					valid and will be removed, and the points reseted.

			<h3>How does the ranking work?</h3>
			<article>
				<p>
					Edain Ranked is based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">ELO system</a>, like Chess.
					This system takes into account both players' rating in order to calculate a new rating. For example, 
					losing a game vs a higher ranked opponent will make you lose less points than if you lose against somebody of
					your level or lower. You will get 1000 ELO points upon register, and start winning/losing as soon as your replay gets submitted.

			<h3>Seasons and events</h3>
			<article>
				<p>
					The ladder experience is divided into seasons, each lasting approximately 3 months. At the end of each season,
					the ranking is saved and displayed, an Edain-related event can take place (such as a tournament, mini-league, showmatches...)
					and the ladder gets a soft-reset, similar to League of Legends ladder. The exact calculation is: <br><br>
					((Current ELO - 1000) / 2) + 1000 = Soft Reset ELO <br><br>

					Examples: <br>
					((950 - 1000) / 2) + 1000 = 975 <br>
					((1200 - 1000) / 2) + 1000 = 1100 <br>

			<h3>Improving and learning</h3>
			<article>
				<p>
					Playing a competitive RTS game is always challenging, specially for newcomers. Having your games
					ranked and losing to other players can be discouraging and lead to loss of motivation. For this reason,
					a correct mindset is required. First of all, realize that EVERYBODY loses. Even experienced players with
					years of experience and high understanding of the game lose quite a lot. And they lost even more when they
					were starting. The difference between a good and a bad player is not the amount of loses, but the way they
					handle defeat. You will be in a good path if you keep learning from your mistakes and practising the essential 
					skills needed to succeed. <br>
					For this purpose, will compile the best guides available in the <a href="links.html">links section</a>.
